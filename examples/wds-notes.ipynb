    "- the shards of a tar file are numbered like `something-000000.tar` to `something-012345.tar`, usually specified using brace notation `something-{000000..012345}.tar`\n",
    "\n",
    "WebDataset can read files from local disk or from any pipe, which allows it to access files using common cloud object stores. WebDataset can also read concatenated MsgPack and CBORs sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WebDataset representation allows writing purely sequential I/O pipelines for large scale deep learning. This is important for achieving high I/O rates from local storage (3x-10x for local drives compared to random access) and for using object stores and cloud storage for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WebDataset format represents images, movies, audio, etc. in their native file formats, making the creation of WebDataset format data as easy as just creating a tar archive. Because of the way data is aligned, WebDataset works well with block deduplication as well and aligns data on predictable boundaries.\n",
